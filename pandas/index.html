<h1>Fun facts you should know:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Giant pandas are solitary animals. In the wild, they have their own territory, and they do not allow it to be invaded by other pandas. </li>
        <li>Pandas used to eat meat, when giant predators like saber-tooth tigers were no longer around, pandas didn't need to be as fast and turned into bamboo-eating specialists to avoid becoming extinct themselves.</li>
        <li>Giant pandas do not hibernate because their bamboo-based diet prevents them from storing enough fat to sleep through the winter.</li>
        <li>Thanks to conservation efforts to save giant pandas, their population is now over 2,200. Their wild population has increased to 1,864, and the number of captive-bred giant pandas has reached 422. Therefore, their threat level has been reduced from "endangered" to "vulnerable". </li>
        <li>Wild pandas usually have just one cub, while pandas in captivity are more likely to have twins. In the wild, If the mother panda has two cubs, she will only feed the one she thinks is stronger. The other one is left to fend for itself.</li>
